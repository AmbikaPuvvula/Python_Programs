# Python_Programs

Objective of the program
To impart hands on training on Python to solve complex problems.


Day-wise Schedule


Day	Syllabus

Day 1

Python â€“ Numbers, Strings, Variables, operators, expressions, statements, String operations, Math function calls, Input/Output statements, Conditional If, while and for loops, User defined Functions, parameters to functions, recursive functions, Turtle Graphics.

Example Problems on Python Programming :

1.	Finding maximum of 3 numbers
2.	Unit converters
3.	Interest calculators
4.	Multiplication tables
5.	Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers


Day 2	

Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Strings, Files and their libraries. Beautiful Idiomatic approach to solve programming problems.

Example Problems on Python Programming :
1.	Fibonacci series generation
2.	prime number generation
3.	Minimum, Maximum and average of n numbers
4.	Linear search (Iterative and Recursive)
5.	Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)

Day 3	

Turtle Bar Chart, Event Driven programming. Key press events, Mouse events, timer events.

Example Problems on Python Programming :
1. Binary to Decimal Conversion / Perfect Number
2. Sorting numbers from a text file
3. Design a Python script to determine the difference in date for given two dates in YYYY:MM:DD format(0 <= YYYY <= 9999, 1 <= MM <= 12, 1 <= DD <= 31) following the leap year rules.
4.  Design a Python Script to determine the time difference between two given times in HH:MM:SS format.( 0 <= HH <= 23, 0 <= MM <= 59, 0 <= SS <= 59)

Day 4	

Example Problems on Python Programming :

1. Design a Python Script to find the value of (Sine, Cosine, Log, PI, e ) of a given number using infinite series of the function.
2. Design a Python Script to convert a given number to words
3. Design a Python Script to convert a given number to roman number.
4. Design a Python Script to generate the frequency count of words in a text file.
5. Design a Python Script to print a spiral pattern for a 2 dimensional matrix.
6. Design a Python Script to implement Gaussian Elimination method.
7. Design a Python script to generate statistical reports(Minimum, Maximum, Count, Average, Sum etc) on public datasets.
8. Design a Python script using the Turtle graphics library to construct a turtle bar chart representing the grades obtained by N students read from a file categorising them into distinction, first class, second class, third class and failed.
